		A cemetery is used as a resting place for citizens that have passed away. When a citizen dies, if there is room,
		a grave will appear in the cemetery. Cemeteries are variable sized - you can have large cemeteries with many graves, or 
		small plots wherever you like.
		^p
		When a citizen dies, their children and spouse lose happiness. If a spot for a grave in a cemetery is available,
		the happiness loss won't be as severe. This happiness loss will be recovered over time if the citizen is in a 
		happy environment. 
		^p
		Tombstones will decay after many years, allowing reuse of a full cemetery. 	Care must be taken in placement 
		of a cemetery. If a cemetery is removed, the tombstones will remain and decay naturally. Only then can the 
		area be used for other purposes.
		^p
		Citizens living near a cemetery will get a slight happiness boost.
