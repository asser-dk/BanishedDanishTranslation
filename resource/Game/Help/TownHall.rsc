		The ^dDialogTownHallNomad ^s tab shows the current state of nomads in the town. When nomads arrive
		you can either allow or deny citizenship to the nomads. Allowing nomads into the town can 
		boost the population quickly, but they can also bring an increased chance of disease to the town.

		You may want to build ^abBoardingHouse boarding houses^ae to house nomads when you accept them into your 
		town so that they have a temporary place to live until you can build them proper homes.
		^p
		^jc ^dDialogTownHall6 ^jl
		The ^dDialogTownHallTrade ^s tab shows seeds and livestock that have been acquired at the trading post.
		This allows you to visualize which seeds you've bought, and how many are remaining.
