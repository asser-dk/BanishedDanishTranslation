		A market is used as a centralized location for all goods that a town produces. Market ^i0ProfessionVendor ^abProfession vendors^ae will
		visit many different ^abStockPile stock piles^ae and ^abStorageBarn storage barns^ae to collect
		the full variety of resources that the town produces. 
		^p
		Citizens that live near a market will use the market to collect goods, rather than taking long walks to outlying storage areas.
		^p
		The market can also provide citizens with a large variety of food which will help keep them healthy and happy. 
		Without a market citizens are unlikely to get a varied and balanced diet, since they'll collect all 
		their food from the closest storage barn.
