		A boarding house is meant for temporary housing. After a ^abDisaster disaster^ae occurs, or when nomads arrive in the town,
		you may need a place for the displaced people to live until you can build more houses or repair damaged ones.

		Boarding houses work in the same way as ^abWoodHouse wood houses^ae and ^abStoneHouse stone houses,^ae except they
		can house five families at a time. 
		^p
		Citizens will live in a boarding house if it's the only place they can find shelter. Otherwise they prefer to have their own home, as 
		it makes them happier. Young people ready to move out of their parents house won't move into a boarding house.
