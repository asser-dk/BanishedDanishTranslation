		A quarry is used to cut stone from the ground. A quarry needs to be placed in a large flat area.
		Once built, ^i0ProfessionStoneCutter ^s ^abProfession stonecutters ^ae will work in the quarry, digging it deeper and deeper
		while producing stone. 
		^p
		Quarries take more work to produce stone than ^abRemoveStone collecting it from the landscape.^ae However it is the only 
		way to produce stone - other than through ^abTradingPost trading ^ae -  after the loose stone on the ground has been collected. 
		^p

		won't ever be available for any other use.
		^p
		Quarries are dangerous - the chance of workers dying in a accident is higher than any other profession.
